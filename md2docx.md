# Overview

This is probably the simplest project. It will just turn one or more markdown
files into a DOCX file using a DOCX template to provide structure, headers
and footers, title page etc.

The version of markdown should support a kind of plugins to allow e.g.
graphviz or plantuml embedded in the input document.

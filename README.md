# List of ideas

This repository contains a number of things which apparently do not exist, but which I would use if they existed.
The licence for all documents in this repository is CC-BY-NC-SA, so you
cannot use this to implement commercially. Using the contained documents as
design documents for a commercial product counts as a commercial use.
Rewriting the documents to create a real design document would be creating a
derivative which would also be CC-BY-NC-SA and above restrictions would still
hold. Anyway, there is no reason not to create a non-commercial product or talk to me about alternatives.

All ideas are described in detail in their own file and will be fledged out
with time.

# Ideas

- AI Mind: sophisticated NPC AI
- Firefox Extension for bookmarking with local searching
- Work Management tool
- MORPG: game relying on procedural generation
- graPHI: create graphs, pictures and diagrams textually (TeX for graphs)
- Wiki: git for storage, extensible MD as language, export to high quality PDF and DOCX
- MD to DOCX converter using templates
- automatic asset extraction from videos (especially poses and faces)
- 3D Modeler working like LEGO, meaning you are actually building instead of modeling
- something like Xtext targeting Netbeans, but more flexible
- something like Xtend, but using plain Java + annotations
- a shared whiteboard application, where freehand drawings are automatically converted into a real diagram, as soon as an element is done

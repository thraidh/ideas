# List of ideas

This repository contains a number of things which apparently do not exist, but which I would use if they existed.
The licence for all documents in this repository is CC-BY-NC-SA, so you are not allowed to use them or the contained ideas commercially. If you implement some of the ideas, you must do so under an Open Source licence or talk to me.

All ideas are described in detail in their own file.

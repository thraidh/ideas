# Overview

This is just a normal wiki with markdown as input language and git as storage.
What sets this apart is the possibility to export one or more pages as high
quality PDF or DOCX files, which can immediately used as publishable
documentation.

The markdown dialect should be extensible, so that graphviz or plantuml and
other text-based image generators can be embedded into the page, without any
steps on side of the user. The resulting image should be the same in the
generated HTML page and exported PDF or DOCX, but the best representation
should be chosen (eg. something vector based for the PDF to avoid blocky
pixels).

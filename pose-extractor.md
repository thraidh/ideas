# Overview

This idea is about a system which analyzes videos and extracts poses of 
displayed persons. It will also adjust to simulated skeleton to the size of 
the person or at least the proportions.
A second system will do the same for faces.

The reason for this is to help all those people who are not artistical enough
to do that by hand (like me).

# Overview

This is the idea for a game. Some might call it an MMORPG, and I admit, that WOW
actually is an inspiration (mostly because it is the only MMORPG I actually
played).
But as I played I noticed two things: most of the time I actually played alone,
doing quests, but had few contacts to other players. Most of the time I didn't
even see them or when I did they annoyed me, because they made my questing
harder because they had the same objectives as I had.
I did chat with some friends and occasionally we quested together.
This probably describes most peoples experiences in that part of the game.
The other part is played in instances, where you cannot meet other people
except those who entered the instance with you. This part of the game takes up
almost all of the end-game.
So actually you do not really play an MMORPG, or when you do, you actually
rather wish you wouldn't.
This is all the perspective of a non-PvP player. If you are in PvP, you might
want to meet other players in the wild to kill them, but most of the time
you'll spend your time in battlefields or arena matches.

Therefore I propose an MORPG, e.g. limit the actual game completely to instances
with a common lobby, where you cannot actually do anything, except communicate,
share, sell, buy and gather people to play the next instance.

In contrast to WOW there are instances for every number of players, including
those for a single player. Also in contrast to WOW, instances also include
questing.

Oh, and there is the minor thing of procedural generation, which is used for
landscapes, buildings and quests. Yes, it will be hard to get it into a state
where procedural quests will be interesting.

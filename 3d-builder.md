# Overview

This is a 3D modeler, whose primary mode of operation is combining things from
parts. It relies heavily on CSG, procedural generation and simulating real-world
modeling techniques, like you would do with clay, welding metal parts together
or simply cutting things.
This makes such a modeler bad for organic things, like living beings, but excels
at building things which are built in the real world as well.
